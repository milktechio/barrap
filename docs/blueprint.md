## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep eggplant (#672CBC) to align to details and titles color; select hue analogous to user specification; also, it pops against a dark background, creating an engaging contrast.
- Background color: Dark navy (#0F101E) as requested by the user.
- Accent color: Teal blue (#10A6C2), for CTAs and interactive elements. Complementary and contrasting.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to improve readability in the descriptions and general information.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for titles to maintain a clear hierarchy and consistency across sections.
- Emphasize a single, clear call to action (connecting a Phantom wallet) prominently on the page, ideally near the top. Subsequent important calls to action would encourage exploration of products and subscription benefits.
